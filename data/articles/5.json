		"<p>ABEV – Even though beer consumption dipped last year, the reopening of restaurants this year has been pushing up beer company sales. That is why we think it could be wise now to evaluate established beer companies Ambev (ABEV) and Boston Beer (SAM) to identify which one is a better buy now? Read more to find out.</p>",
		"<p>Based in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Ambev S.A. (ABEV - Get Rating) produces, distributes, sells beer, draft beer, carbonated soft drinks, other non-alcoholic beverages, malt, and food products. Its segments include Brazil, Central America and the Caribbean, Latin America South, and Canada. In comparison, The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM - Get Rating) produces and sells alcoholic beverages primarily in the United States. In addition to its flagship beer—Samuel Adams Boston Lager—it also offers hard ciders and hard seltzers under the Twisted Tea, Angry Orchard, Dogfish Head, and Concrete Beach brand names.</p>",
		"<p>The beer industry suffered a setback amid the COVID-19 pandemic due to a dip in retail beer sales, with several stadiums, concert venues, bars, and restaurants closing their doors or operating at limited capacity. However, beer consumption is expected to increase in the coming months with the reopening of bars and restaurants with precautions to limit the spread of COVID-19. According to a Business Wire report, the global beer market is expected to reach $710.89 billion by 2025. So, both ABEV and SAM should benefit.</p>",
		"<p>ABEV has gained 0.3% in price year-to-date, while SAM generated negative returns. Also, ABEV’s 11.6% gains over the past nine months are higher than SAM’s negative returns. Furthermore, ABEV is the clear winner in terms of the past nine months’ performance, with 34.1% price gains versus SAM’s negative returns.</p>",
		"<p>But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Let’s find out.</p>",
		"<h6>Latest Developments</h6>",
