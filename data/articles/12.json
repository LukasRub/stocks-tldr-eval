		"<p>Benchmarks have leaked supposedly revealing the performance of Intel's Core i9-12900K, Core i7-12700K and Core i5-12600K Alder Lake CPUs, courtesy of www.cpu-monkey.com.</p>",
		"<p>The new results show both single-threaded and multi-threaded scores in Cinebench R20 and give Intel a clear lead over all of AMD's current mainstream desktop CPUs.</p>",
		"<p>Below you can see my own recent benchmark results from my reviews of Intel's 111th Gen CPUs such as the Core i9-11900K in Cinebench R20 along with the leaked results for the Core i5-12600K, Core i7-12700K and Core i9-12900K Alder Lake CPUs.</p>",
		"<p>[Figure detailing a few of Intel CPUs specifications]</p>",
		"<p>[Figure detailing Intel CPUs and competing CPUs performances on Cinebench R20 Single-threaded benchmark]</p>",
		"<p>The Core i9-12900K's result of 817 in the single-threaded testis miles ahead of AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X - it's best result, and the latter is even bettered by the Core i5-12600K, which scored 750. Admittedly, single-threaded performance isn't an indicator of general performance, but we can see just how much faster the new CPUs are compared to both AMD and Intel's current models on a single-threaded basis.</p>",
		"<p>[Figure detailing Intel CPUs and competing CPUs performances on Cinebench R20 Multi-threaded benchmark]</p>",
		"<p>The multi-threaded test showed that only an overclocked 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X was able to beat the stock speed Intel Core i9-12900K, with the Intel CPU offering a sizable lead at stock speed. The Core i7-12700K was also snapping at the heels of the AMD 16-core CPU, despite a four-core deficit.</p>",
		"<p>Speaking of cores, it's worth remembering that Intel will be using hybrid cores with its Alder Lake CPUs. Each CPU will comprise big or 'performance' cores as well as smaller 'efficient' cores.</p>",
		"<p>The former are hyper-threaded, but the latter are not. For example, the Core i9-12900K will have two threads for each of its eight performance cores (16 threads) but only one thread for each of its efficient cores. This means that despite being a 16-core CPU like AMD's Ryzen 9 5950X, it only has 24 threads instead of 32.</p>",
		"<p>However, as we can see above, if these benchmarks are to be believed, the thread deficit doesn't mean much as the CPU is gaining a lot of ground thanks to its new architecture as well as performance enhancements such as Thread Director, that will mean its Alder Lake CPUs will run faster on Windows 11.</p>",
		"<p>I'll be reviewing the new CPUs when they're released so follow me here on Forbes for the latest PC hardware news and reviews and don't forget to check me out on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook as well.</p>"
