		"<p>Department stores of the future will operate with tighter inventories, speedy delivery and a host of merchandise partners. They will be profitable and will concentrate on developing smaller selling units.</p>",
		"<p>Last week Macy’s and Kohl’s reported sales and earnings for the second quarter of 2021. Sales and earnings for both companies were above expectations, and the companies dutifully raised their sales and earnings expectations for the rest of the fiscal year. Their enthusiasm is justified. Things are more normal and even women’s dresses are selling at a better pace. The back-to-school business has been generating strong demand for children’s clothing and adult apparel, suggesting that the third quarter of the current year had a strong start despite the fact that the Delta variant of the coronavirus has rekindled fear among consumers.</p>",
		"<p>All retail companies were complaining about delays in their supply lines and cost of transportation. There were delays at ports and lack of available of container ships. Obviously, there were steep cost increases and delays on overland trucking. It all adds to increased operating costs that haves to be passed on to the consumer – in other words, inflationary pressures are forcing retail prices to be higher. But, clearly, pent up demand motivated consumers to still shop.</p>",
		"<h6>More Partnerships Help Sustain Growth</h6>",
		"<p>Macy’s – One of the most important announcements Macy’s made during the conference call last Thursday was the fact that the company has partnered with Toys “R’ Us to be in more than 400 stores for this holiday season. Toys “R” Us will be available in all stores next year. The brand is on-line right now. The Toys “R” Us brand is well known, and the expertise of seasoned toy merchants will serve the Macy’s customer well. Geoffrey the Giraffe will be greeting children in the toy department. (The company was founded by Charles Lazarus in 1957. Recently, Toys “R” Us was liquidated and the brand is now owned by WHP Global Partners).</p>",
		"<p>It Is important to note that toys are bought in the “locker stock”, merchandise is withdrawn from locker stock when a customer buy the toy. Toy sales and toy inventory will have to be paid on the 10th of January of the year following the selling season. I am excited that Macy’s has made a partnership with WHP Global to insure a full assortment early and throughout the holiday season.</p>",
		"<p>Partnerships are important and whether it is Lids, Sunglass Hut, Sketchers or Best Buy (BBY), Macy’s partnerships with vendors have given customers better selections. In addition, trained sales associates that know their products in depth make customers more comfortable in their purchases.</p>",
		"<p>Kohl’s – Michelle Gass, CEO and President, is very excited about the opening of Sephora shops in Kohl’s stores. 70 units were opened last Friday and there will be 200 open by the end of the year and about 850 shop-in-shops by the time 2023 closes. The three stores that opened Sephora shops earlier this month gave management the optimism of a successful partnership that will bring young customers to the Kohl’s stores. While Kohl’s management tried to upgrade the cosmetic departments in the past with new fragrances and other beauty items, this partnership brings Sephora’s trained sales people to assist customers in their selection. It is a win for Kohl’s and it joins other Kohl’s partnerships like Lands’ End, Eddie Bauer, Cole Haan, and Champion.</p>",
		"<p>Kohl’s has shifted to selling young action-wear national brands like Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Champion, and Vans. The current focus on denims from Levi and Lauren Conrad reflects heightened attention to brands that appeal to younger customers. Management has indicated that they are striving to have 30% of their sales in action-wear brands.</p>",
		"<h6>Conclusion</h6>",
		"<p>European department stores have many departments that are operated by fashion brands. Some major stores like Galeries Lafayette have more than 60% of their store owned and operated by fashion leaders like Dior, Gucci, and Yves St. Laurent. That is not the case in the United States. While there are some partnerships, it is less than 10% in most stores. Sure, Macy’s raised the bar by having a Toy’s “R” Us operation in most of the stores by next year. I think that relationship will be very successful. There are many others – Armani in Bloomingdale’s, Gucci in Macy’s Herald Square, and Nordstrom’s (JWN) that has relationships with Top Shop, Indochine and Jerry Lorenzo.</p>",
		"<p>As we come out of the pandemic, we will see more partnerships that will highlight designers and expert merchants. The need for these talented people to be part of the retail scene revives excitement, expertise and well-timed fashion savvy.</p>",
		"<p>N.B. Macy’s reported in their second quarter 2021 a +61.2 % increase in comparable owned sales. Earnings per diluted shares rose from a loss of ($1.39) to $1.08. Total sales rose to $5.68 billion from $3.96 billion. Kohl’s sales rose from $3.4 billion to $4.4 billion, a +30.5% increase. Diluted shares rose from a loss of $(0.25) to $2.48.</p>"
