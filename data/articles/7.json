		"<p>In a statement, Norwegian president and CEO Harry Sommer called the news “a significant milestone in our Great Cruise Comeback from the U.S.”</p>",
		"<p>\"We have a 30-year history of cruising from New York and were the first to sail from the destination year-round. Our return feels like a homecoming. This fall, as New York comes back to life after more than a year, with Broadway and other top attractions opening back up, we are honored to be part of its story and to provide travelers easy access to a safe and exceptional warm-weather vacation experience from one of the top cruise destinations on the East Coast.\"</p>",
		"<p>The ship is the 6th of Norwegian’s 17-ship fleet to restart since the July restart of Norwegian Jade. Most recently, Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway both returned to normal operations in the Mediterranean.</p>",
		"<p>All of Norwegian’s 2021 sailings will require guests to be fully vaccinated. It's part of NCL's plan to sail in an environment that Frank Del Rio considers \"the safest place on earth.\"</p>"
