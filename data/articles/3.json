		"<h3>EV Competition Has Arrived: Does Tesla Have The Answer?</h3>",
		"<p>Summary</p>",
		"<p>1. Tesla set the standard when it comes to electric vehicles.</p>",
		"<p>2. Now, Tesla is starting to face competition as legacy automakers and startups like Lucid Motors are bringing their electric vehicles to market.</p>",
		"<p>3. Tesla trades at a high 20x P/S and is overvalued.</p>",
		"<p>4. Tesla is taking the best approach when it comes to developing AI thanks to the significant amount of data it's collecting.</p>",
		"<p>5. I'm neutral on Tesla.</p>",
		"<p>6. This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community, Beating the Market.</p>",
		"<h6>Investment Thesis</h6>",
		"<p>When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) IPOd in 2010, EV cars weren’t as popular as they are today, and Tesla, with a visionary leader in Elon Musk, became the global EV giant that’s set the standard for high-quality EVS. However, Tesla’s stock price is up 700% over the past 18 months and it’s no longer a speculative play like it was a few years ago. Now that the EV market is heating up, Tesla faces more competition than it ever has, and its current valuation, Tesla is undoubtedly expensive, trading 325x price to FCF.</p>",
		"<p>Tesla is facing competition on multiple fronts, whether that be EV competitors in China or the legacy automakers such Ford (NYSE:F), Toyota (NYSE:TM), and Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF). In this article, I will highlight Tesla's competition and the threat to lose EV market share, specifically in China, which has a large, growing EV market. Other younger EV companies such as Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID) and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) are improving products vehicles and offer viable EV cars with autonomous driving features.</p>",
		"<p>Tesla is trading at 20x price to sales, which is significantly higher than it was two years ago when it was trading at 1.5x. Considering Tesla’s main revenue stream is a lower-margin business compared to that of a software company, a 20x P/S is extremely high. Considering that its valuation has run up and the competition is increasing, I label Tesla as a hold.</p>",
		"<h6>Introduction</h6>",
		"<p>Tesla faces many challenges ahead, but Tesla currently is the No. 1 EV company for a reason. Here’s a summary for what I will cover in this article and how Tesla will evolve its offerings, taking advantage of the massive amounts of data its cars collect. Tesla’s real value will come from the data it's collecting to create superior AI to understand how people drive and provide them with better services.</p>",
		"<p>First, I’ll provide analysis of the increasingly competitive EV landscape, highlighting the growing market when it comes to EV startups and legacy automakers reverting away from gas powered vehicles</p>",
		"<p>Then analyze the situation in China, exploring how Tesla had a favorable start entering this region, but since COVID it’s dealt with problems with its cars in China and it could face political risks as China would rather endorse local EV companies.</p>",
		"<p>How will Tesla respond? By continuing to innovate.</p>",
		"<p>Tesla’s AI gets stronger over time as its software processes more data, so the more data that its fleet collects, the more its AI has to interpret and analyze.</p>",
		"<p>Tesla will use this data to empower its AI software for autonomous driving and further expanding vertically to insurance products.</p>",
		"<p>Now let's explore the increasingly-competitive landscape.</p>",
		"<h6>Legacy Competition</h6>",
		"<p>In 2019, there were more than 91 million vehicles sold and 1% of them were EVs. EV sales are expected to rise from 3 million in 2020 to 66 million by 2040 and make up two-thirds of total car sales. The days of the internal combustion engine are numbered as more countries are banning the sale of ICE vehicles. President Biden recently set the goal for 50% of U.S. car sales to be electric by 2030 while the UK announced it's banning the sale of ICE vehicles starting 2030, and with California imposing the ban by 2035.</p>",
		"<p>As illustrated above, the EV market is about to see exponential growth and legacy automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF) have announced plans to only sell electric vehicles by 2035. Tesla has a first-mover advantage and created the standard when it comes to driving an EV as your everyday car, but the competition is starting to pile up.</p>",
		"<p>Here are the current Tesla models that can be used to compare to the legacy automakers' EVs. [Table of comparison between various Ford, VW, Nissan, Kia, Audi, Porche, Jaguar, BMW models]</p>",
		"<p>More legacy car companies such as Mercedes and Lexus also have announced plans to enter the EV market. Given the new EVs set to hit the market, consumers now have options when choosing a luxurious or compact EV. Autonomous driving features are now a standard in these vehicles as well. Now, competitors are starting to enter the EV market and directly compete with Tesla. Consumers now have a lot of options to choose from when they go to buy an EV.</p>",
		"<h6>New Competition</h6>",
		"<p>Lucid Motors produces luxury vehicles that are supposed to be in line with Mercedes or Rolls Royce, making them the luxury of EVs. Lucid Motor’s CEO, Peter Rawlinson, was an executive at Tesla prior to joining Lucid Motors in 2013 and Rawlinson was influential in bringing Tesla’s Model S to market. He helped re-engineer the design of the Model 3 when he joined Tesla in 2009. Rawlinson was Vice President of Engineering at Tesla and Chief Vehicle Engineer of the Model S. Lucid, the California-based start-up, announced its transition into the EV market, from making EV batteries in 2016 with its first model, the Lucid Air, being released in the second half of 2022.</p>",
		"<p>The Lucid Air will directly compete with Tesla’s Model S Plaid, which is Tesla’s fastest and most luxurious car yet. Tesla’s Model S Plaid goes from 0-60 MPH in 3.1 seconds while Lucid does 0-60 MPH in 2.7 seconds and beats the Plaid version on range. Lucid’s high-tech luxurious cars will enter a crowded luxury car market and look to create a similar buzz to that of Tesla when it first released its Roadster.</p>",
		"<p>Xpeng is a Chinese EV company and is expected to release its P5 model in China this October for $27,400. Xpeng uses lidar for its autonomous driving, which differs from Tesla’s approach of using cameras to create a “vision” approach. Lidar shoots lasers and essentially creates 3-D maps to sense its surroundings. Xpeng’s P5 will directly compete with Tesla’s Model 3 as it offers lower prices with similar ranges.</p>",
		"<p>Xpeng is one of the up-and-coming Chinese EVs and will compete with Tesla in China when its cars are released next month. There are 300-plus EV makers in China and there will be more competition and consolidation within this market. Other Chinese EV companies like Nio are a threat to Tesla as well as other startups' EVs such as Rivian, another California-based startup, which is backed by Ford and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p>",
		"<h6>China Threat</h6>",
		"<p>There were 1.3 million EVs sold in China last year, which means that China accounted for 41% of global EV sales. Prior to 2020, China welcomed Tesla and made accommodations for it, such as removing Tesla from the 10% new-vehicle tax or helping Tesla get its manufacturing sites up and running faster than usual. China used Tesla to encourage competition within China EV companies that weren’t producing competitive EVs to fulfill the demand and consumer expectations within the country. China saw the need for EVs within its country and used Tesla to fulfill the demand.</p>",
		"<p>Now, China doesn’t need Tesla to support the demand in EVs as companies like Nio, BYO, and XPeng now offer competitive alternatives. The CCP most likely would prefer to support local companies rather than enable a U.S. company to be the leading EV seller in China. We’ve seen the threat of political intervention in Chinese tech stocks, and Tesla could face a similar threat. Tesla recently had some recalls for Model 3s in China as some were experiencing random accelerations. The Chinese EV market is expected to grow significantly, but the political risk and risk from local competition make Tesla’s future in the region hazy.</p>",
		"<p>Clearly, Tesla has a lot working against them on the competition front as well as in China. However, Tesla still has a first-mover advantage and is collecting a significant amount of data that will help prevent and reduce car accidents.</p>",
		"<h6>Tesla's Data Will Win Out</h6>",
		"<p>Tesla takes a vision approach to its autonomous driving, which means that it uses the cameras and sensors on its cars to act as the eyes of the vehicle while its software is essentially the brain and powered by AI. The more data you feed into AI, the better and better it gets. Dojo is Tesla’s “neural network” which was developed in-house and processes video that Tesla collects. Dojo is used to oversee the prediction process in its cars. Tesla recently announced its D1 chip that will be the fastest training computer for AI (according to a Tesla employee) which will be crucial for enabling the AI that should be necessary for fully autonomous vehicles.</p>",
		"<p>For Tesla’s competitors taking the lidar approach, it's much easier for them to reach level 3 or 4 of autonomy, but much more difficult for them to scale to level 5. Lidar usually is much more expensive than the approach Tesla is taking as the cost of a Waymo car with Lidar is estimated to cost $180,000 while a Model 3 costs $37,490. Tesla’s approach differs from the lidar approach as it is extremely difficult to start with a vision approach as Tesla’s software starts knowing nothing and must completely learn how to drive by accumulating more data. This happens by Tesla’s software collecting miles and real data. The image above highlights how this will pay off as it will be easier for Tesla to scale to reach level 5 automation.</p>",
		"<p>As Tesla accumulates more data, its software gets continually better and better, making it difficult to get off the ground, but once it gets to level 3 of autonomy, it's much easier to scale to fully autonomous level 5. Tesla already is at level 2 autonomy, while Musk has said that Tesla will have level 5 autonomy by the end of 2021. Musk is known to be extremely optimistic when it comes to Tesla’s ambitions and future releases, so I don’t expect this to be any different, but Tesla is still ahead of its competitors when it comes to collecting data.</p>",
		"<p>Tesla’s system is powered by AI and this is only possible because of the abundance of data that Tesla collects whether during the manufacturing process or while its vehicles are on the road. The information that Tesla collects will empower fully autonomous vehicles, but more importantly it will allow Tesla to outsource its autonomous driving software as well as use AI to offer products such as Tesla Insurance.</p>",
		"<p>Tesla Insurance - Tesla is extremely vertically integrated. Tesla makes their own parts, writes its own code, as well as handles the sales for its vehicles, so there’s no better company that understands Tesla cars than Tesla itself. This is because Tesla has so many vehicles on the road today equipped with autonomous driving capabilities, specifically Tesla’s latest autopilot hardware that collects information from eight cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors on the vehicle. It’s Tesla’s wide-vertical expansion that enables it to truly benefit from manufacturing the hardware and engineering the software to go along with it. Tesla sees that its AI will be its best asset to leverage moving forward, thanks to its growing amount of data.</p>",
		"<p>For example, usually, actuaries analyze the risk using math and statistics to design insurance policies. However, Tesla Insurance leverages the vast amount of data collected from Tesla vehicles to better position its underwriters to offer competitive quotes. This results in better quotes for more rewarding drivers and results in one’s insurance being decided by their driving behavior rather than statistics and categories one falls under. Tesla insurance is currently offered in California, while it’s expected to be rolled out in Texas, Washington, and Illinois.</p>",
		"<p>Similar to how Tesla’s Autonomous Driving gets better with more data and will eventually hit full self-driving, Tesla’s insurance offering should get better as well. Tesla’s data collection is still a competitive differentiation and Tesla will need to monetize its proprietary data and AI whether that’s offering new products or services like ride hauling or outsourcing its software to other legacy automakers. Tesla’s data will prove its greatest asset over time.</p>",
		"<p>Now, let’s explore Tesla’s valuation.</p>",
		"<h6>Pricey Valuation</h6>",
		"<p>Tesla is trading at 325x price to FCF while it sports 20x price to sales. Tesla is expected to generate ~$50 billion in revenue in 2021, while its market cap is $755 billion. Tesla's valuation is optimistic and accelerated growth already is being priced into the share price which will make it difficult for Tesla's multiples to expand or remain this high, as its business matures. Tesla’s main automotive operations are a low-margin business (24% gross profit margins). Therefore, the market is trading Tesla at a premium.</p>",
		"<h6>Tesla Valuation</h6>",
		"<p>To evaluate a fair value for Tesla, we'll deploy the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model. The model consists of a discounted cash flow model using free cash flow per share to assist in identifying Tesla’s value today, taking into account the change in shares outstanding. Additionally, the model uses the growth of free cash flow per share to determine Tesla's 10-year price target, and thereby, market cap, allowing us to project Tesla’s growth over the next 10 years.</p>",
		"<p>Based on our model, Tesla’s share price is nearly 50% overvalued trading at $755 per share. Investors are paying a hefty price if they choose to invest in Tesla today, especially given the rise in stock price over the past 18 months.</p>",
		"<h6>Expected Return</h6>",
		"<p>An investment today is expected to generate an 11% annual return, which is below the 15% hurdle rate we use. Therefore, Tesla returns aren’t attractive for long-term investors while there are better places to invest capital in stocks whose market cap isn’t as stretched as with Tesla.</p>",
		"<p>For the model, I used a 10% free cash flow margin and a 30% growth rate in free cash flow over the next 10 years. A 10% free cash flow margin is conservative as Tesla sports a 9.5% gross profit margin. Tesla is growing revenues at nearly 100% year-over-year, so a 30% growth rate in free cash flow should prove accurate over the next 10 years.</p>",
		"<h6>Risks</h6>",
		"<p>1. Tesla is collecting vast amounts of data from more than 1 million Teslas on the road today. Musk has been adamant that Tesla self-driving capabilities will be at full automation by the end of 2021, but I fear that this is way too early for investors to expect FSD. Tesla technically hasn't passed level 2 autonomy and it could be a few years away from releasing FSD software.</p>",
		"<p>2. The supply-chain shortages also could negatively impact Tesla's near future as Tesla already has pushed by the long-waited release of its Cyber Truck and the Roadster.</p>",
		"<p>3. Other risks that Tesla faces are the increasing rise of competitors in the market as Legacy automakers are now releasing EVs. This risk as well as risks in China were highlighted above.</p>",
		"<h6>Conclusion</h6>",
		"<p>Tesla is on top of the EV market, it set the standard, and now it's facing competition from all angles as the incumbents and new companies look to redefine the EV standard that Tesla established. I don't think the competition will necessarily dethrone Tesla, but its high valuation makes the share price too high, considering that competition and large market opportunity for other companies. Tesla's remains extremely well positioned to continue to collect data and build the optimal AI software that will enable Tesla to expand its revenue streams.</p>",
		"<p>I’ve been a long-time investor in Tesla and have no plans on selling anytime soon, but the valuation leads me to rate the stock as “avoid” when considering adding new capital to the position.</p>"
