		"<h3>AMD CEO Sees Chip Shortage Easing in 2022</h3>",
		"<p>The semiconductor shortage will begin to ease in 2022, Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su said at a session Monday at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills.</p>",
		"<p>In an on-stage interview with Code Conference producer Kara Swisher and CNBC tech reporter Jon Fortt, the AMD (ticker: AMD) chief said that the semiconductor industry is investing aggressively in new capacity, with 20 new factories coming online this year and a similar number expected to come online in 2022.</p>",
		"<p>But Su also noted that the pandemic has “taken demand to a new level,” with every industry seeking more components. “Nobody expected this much demand,” she says.</p>",
		"<p>Su dodged a question about whether AMD was threatened by a shift by some electronics companies to chips designed in house.</p>",
		"<p>Su also said the company continues to expect to close its pending acquisition of Xilinx (XLNX) by year end. She also said that consolidation in the chip industry is “inevitable.”</p>",
		"<p>Asked about the use of AMD chips for crypto currency mining, Su said it is a small part of its business. She says the company is trying hard to get more products to gamers and the core business, rather than on crypto.</p>"

	"summary": "Fresno County Will Soon Be Home to the Largest Green Hydrogen Plant on the West Coast. The project also includes the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility that will supply the water needed by the plant and provide recycled water to Mendota, an increasingly water-stressed agricultural hub in Fresno County. The California facility will expand Plug Power’s network of plants that already includes sites in New York, Tennessee and Georgia. Combined, they will supply 500 tons of liquid green hydrogen daily by 2025, preventing 4.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere.",
