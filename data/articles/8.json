		"<p>One of the casualties of the pandemic was the permanent closing of the ArcLight Cinemas and Pacific Theatres chains. ArcLight Cinemas had 11 locations, including a half-dozen in the Los Angeles area, as well as San Diego; two in Chicago; the Washington, D.C., area; and Boston. Pacific Theatres had six cinemas, all in the L.A. area.</p>",
		"<p>The move flooded the Los Angeles market with more than 400,000 square feet of movie theater real estate — \"an opportunity major chains such as Regal, AMC and Cinemark will likely capitalize on as the three make up nearly 70% of the regional cinema market,\" CBRE Group Inc. noted in a recent report.</p>",
		"<p>Leawood-based AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC) became one of the first movers when it took over Pacific Theatres' flagship theaters, signing long-term leases for the 30,000-square-foot Grove and 43,412-square-foot Americana at Brand cinemas at the Los Angeles and Glendale, California, retail and entertainment complexes owned by luxury real estate developer Caruso. And Regal Cinemas signed a lease to take over the 87,000-square-foot ArcLight theater at the Sherman Oaks Galleria.</p>",
		"<p>That leaves several movie houses and hundreds of thousands of square feet still up for grabs in Tinseltown.</p>",
		"<p>\"The silver screen hasn't lost its luster as some of the biggest players in the industry move to increase their regional footprint,” the CBRE report said.</p>"
